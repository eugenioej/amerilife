        If any part of this Legal Notice is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
        applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability
        limitations set forth above, the invalidity or unenforceability of a particular provision shall

        is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, this provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
        enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and
        modified to match such intent and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
