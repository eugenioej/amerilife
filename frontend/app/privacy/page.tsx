      <p>
        AmeriLife&apos;s website may share your personal information with unaffiliated third
        parties only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is

        the site; protect and defend the rights or property of AmeriLife; act under exigent
        circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of AmeriLife, or the public; in

      <h2>Other Information</h2>
      <p>
        The AmeriLife website uses &quot;cookies&quot; and other technologies to help you
        personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk
        by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
        computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
        domain that issued the cookie to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
        purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
        example, if you personalize AmeriLife pages, or register with the AmeriLife site or
        services, a cookie helps AmeriLife to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
        This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the
        same AmeriLife website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
        easily use the AmeriLife features that you customized.

        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If
        you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the AmeriLife services or websites you visit.

        An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a
        user access the website, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.
        Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites,
        applications, and other services. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage
        levels of the website and helping diagnose server problems.

      <p>
        If you access email or social networking services through our website or social media, we may
